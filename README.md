# Devel::LeakGuard::Object

https://travis-ci.org/paultcochrane/Devel--LeakGuard--Object.svg?branch=master

This module provides tracking of objects, for the purpose of detecting memory
leaks due to circular references or innappropriate caching schemes.

It is derived from, and backwards compatible with Adam Kennedy's
[Devel::Leak::Object](https://metacpan.org/pod/Devel::Leak::Object). Any
errors are mine.
