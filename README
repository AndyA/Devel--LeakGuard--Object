NAME
    Devel::Leak::Object - Detect leaks of objects

SYNOPSIS
      # Track a single object
      use Devel::Leak::Object;
      my $obj = Foo::Bar->new;
      Devel::Leak::Object::track($obj);
  
      # Track every object
      use Devel::Leak::Object qw{ GLOBAL_bless };

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides tracking of objects, for the purpose of detecting
    memory leaks due to circular references or innappropriate caching
    schemes.

    Object tracking can be enabled on a per object basis. Any objects thus
    tracked are remembered until DESTROYed; details of any objects left are
    printed out to stderr at END-time.

      use Devel::Leak::Object qw(GLOBAL_bless);

    This form overloads bless to track construction and destruction of all
    objects. As an alternative, by importing bless, you can just track the
    objects of the caller code that is doing the use.

    If you use GLOBAL_bless to overload the bless function, please note that
    it will ONLY apply to bless for modules loaded AFTER Devel::Leak::Object
    has enabled the hook.

    Any modules already loaded will have already bound to CORE::bless and
    will not be impacted.
